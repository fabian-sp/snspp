# stochastic-ssnal

A Python package for solving problems of the form

`$$ min_x f(x) + \phi(x)$$`

The main contribution of this package is the implementation of the stochastic SSNAL algorithm. As a side product, we provide fast implementaions of SAGA and AdaGrad, two widely known first-order methods.
